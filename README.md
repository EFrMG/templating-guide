# Guide to Handlebars and Nunjucks Templating

Introduction and orientation for Ghost, Metalsmith, Eleventy, and Next.js + Strapi.

The examples are mostly focused to be used by projects were one needs reusable structures,
yet the complexity is not overwhelming as to be able to type the content on a set of files
manually; id est, for blogs or moderately sized businesses with posts and notices for users.

I might restructure the site with routing and add new sections in the future.

All code examples are functional and a good way to realize why templating is useful
without much effort form the reader.
